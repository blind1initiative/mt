            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><h3>Introduction</h3><p>At the end of this course, N-580 -Issues in Nursing Education, the eight core competencies were carefully learned. One of the papers that I have submitted has discussed the core competencies of the nurse educator. This has focused on the advance technology that a student may use in improving the viewing and gathering of data of individuals by using electronic portfolio, web site, and electronic or digitalized media. The course has motivated me to create a website to present my educational and personal history, goals, and aspirations in nursing education. The attitude that this course has brought out in me is the virtue of patience and determination. The challenges in completing the activities in this course have created a sense of fulfillment upon completion of each assignments.<br><br></p><p>The NLN scope of practice has facilitated my learning about the competencies which could be associated to my learning. One of these competencies is the competency 1 or facilitation of learning. This could be associated with my passion in supporting the diverse population of students or staff in facilitating learning. I could reflect my past nursing experiences and associate my current position as IRF/PAI coordinator in promoting team work and collaboration in the clinical and education practice of various disciplines in healthcare. The facilitation of learning through teaching Functional Independence Measures (FIM) to interdisciplinary teams could be a competency that has been achieved.</p><p>The second competency that could be associated to my current job is the competency six, due of the pursuit of continuous quality improvement through effective measurement of outcomes and quality reporting. Through applying the knowledge learned in this course, I may be able to develop more ways in maintaining continuous quality improvement through learning the traditional ways of our facility versus the evidence-based practice or the activities and care that are scientifically proven.<br><br></p><p>The third competency associated with my job is the competency 5 which revolves on the teamwork and collaboration in promoting common goals. This course has taught me the process of teamwork and collaboration with others. The participation in discussions has given me opportunity to learn more about others and work with them in discussing issues that could be affecting nursing education.<br><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">I have attached my submitted work about the core competencies of the nurse educator to fully view the professional development paper.</span></p></div>

My passion in supporting the diverse population of students or staff in facilitating learning through teaching with set strategy that would fit the students’ needs, and outcomes; teaching strategies in providing evidence-based practices; enhancing reflective and critical thinking; improving work relationships with the students, co-workers, and personnel by showing interest and respect, and practice professionalism in nursing (National League for Nursing, 2012). Although I may have sufficient skills in oral and written method of communication, I may still need to improve my electronic communication method of teaching or electronic skills in delivering data. I would like to improve and initiate the e-portfolio experience so I could have an opportunity to review and find out the skills I have enhanced and to keep track on how I am doing.  If I could demonstrate effective communication skills, it may promote teamwork and collaboration in the clinical and educational practice of health professionals (World Health Organization, 2016).</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;I may have given emphasis on competency 1 for a nurse educator. However, there are more competencies which are vital in becoming a nurse educator. These competencies may include competency 2 -facilitating learner development and socialization; competency 3- using assessment and evaluation strategies; competency 4 - participating in curriculum design and evaluation of program outcomes; competency 5 - functioning as a change agent and leader; competency 6 - pursuing continuous quality improvement; competency 7 - engaging in scholarship; and competency 8 -functioning within the educational environment (Billings and Halstead, 2012). I am interested in improving my knowledge and later advise or counsel students by observing the sense of caring, sense of humor, and if given an opportunity to work with these competencies. I may improve my skills in achieving these vital competencies to accomplish the required scope of practice for nurse educators.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;">My job as an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility- Patient Assessment Instrument  Coordinator (IRF-PAI Coordinator) at my workplace has given me an opportunity to work on continuous quality improvement by working together with Payment Prospective Coordinator, Quality Assurance Coordinator, and the Quality Assurance Manager as a team in providing quality collection of data, using the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation (UDSMR) as the biggest database in providing data on functional status of patients based on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Instrument that includes 18 categories covering six areas of level of functioning (Graham, et al., 2014). The direct use of FIM scores based on the patient’s level of function and burden of care could give data on how many days should the patient stay in the facility and how the therapy and medical management affects the patient’s health progress and development in physical therapy. I work with the documentations provided by the interdisciplinary team including nurses, physical therapists, nursing aids, wound care team, dieticians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and the physicians. In addition, I do similar functions in maintaining the quality management on the Long Term Acute Care Unit by utilizing the LTRAX system which is a combined data collection tool and outcomes engine for the long-term acute hospitals with the built-in support for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with patient satisfaction surveys and collection of quality indicators of patients (LTRAX, 2017). Continuous quality improvement as part of my job is under the competency 6. In addition, competency 5 – could be another venue that my work revolves as the promotion of teamwork and collaboration with other disciplines in the hospital is being observed to enhance partnership among health professionals’ education and clinical practice (WHO, 2016).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;">Nurses, nursing aids, physical therapists, recreational therapists, and occupational therapists are being tested every two years for the accreditation of the hospital as required by the CMS. I work with the PPS Coordinator in promoting education through providing once or twice a month FIM training, with provision of FIM tips for the staff that are being included during team huddles. This activity may be categorized under the competency 2, 3, and 4. I may need more skills in the competency 8, which is the management, leadership, and advocacy (WHO, 2016). As there are leadership programs in our hospital, our quality assurance manager serves as the team leader and reports directly to the Director of Nursing. However, regardless of the management task, I could lead the interdisciplinary team in addressing health-care and educational needs. I could also teach and support staff in the proper documentation and integration of proper entry of data.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;">In creating my e-portfolio account, I could review the guidelines and follow my instructor’s guidance. I will include the theoretical basis for nursing practice, statement of professional goals, resume or CV, cover letter, and program outcomes. Another challenge in achieving my goals is time constraints due to my full-job and tasks at home. However, I could overcome it by planning and organizing my tasks, prioritize my education, and enhance my knowledge and skills through self-reflection, critical thinking, and obtaining more learning materials from the text books and from other sources.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; line-height: 1.5; font-style: normal;">It takes patience and determination to accomplish the competencies that I’m planning to include in my e-portfolio. This course could give me an opportunity to understand more about the significance of creating an e-portfolio to enhance communication, develop and improve my profession, and contribute what employers may need in matching job positions as a nurse educator.</span></p></blockquote></div>

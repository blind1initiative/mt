            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Educational theories may reflect unique perspectives with variations in assumptions, values, and beliefs about the process in teaching, and learning process. Nurse educators and students may come from different generations with variant life experiences and gaps in age. However, with numerous educational theories, a connection with the gaps and differences could lead to effective teaching and learning outcomes if suitable theories are chosen as guidance and framework for planning educational system in the classroom or in the clinical setting (Aliakbari, Parvin, Heidari, &amp; Haghani, 2015).</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;Numerous theories in education could be utilized in nursing education. As a student, the behaviorism was the earliest theory that I could associate on my learning. The process of positive reinforcements in my primary, secondary, and nursing education, has revolved in achieving good grades and rewards, in addition to praises from my parents and educators. The principle of behaviorism was integrated early in my system, by developing a response to the reinforcements that has conditioned my behavior and molded my learning capability. This could be associated with the theory of operant conditioning that Skinner has formed when individuals behave because of their past consequences (Utley, 2011). Schunk (2008) has discussed that to apply a negative or positive reinforcement in a situation, the stimuli should be close to the event to promote the process of conditioning, like a situation when a teacher should assess the outcome of the student’s learning by providing prompt feedback (as cited in Utley, 2011). This knowledge could later influence my future nurse educator practice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Cognitive learning theory is another theory that may have given impact in my education by accumulating and processing the perceived knowledge from my mentors. The processing of the information through “visual, auditory, or motor manipulation” (p.74), could either be kept in the short-term or long-term memory (Bastable, 2014). Simulation is another method used in my nursing education as a student that has contributed advantage in my learning.  Simulation could be associated with the adult learning theory, and with cognitive, social, and constructivist theory that could allow the students to avoid harming a patient through practicing skills and activities in the classroom and in the clinical trainings (Rutherford-Hemming, 2012). In this method, the social learning theory may have contributed in the combination of my orientation in behaviorism and cognitivism theories. Through simulation, my involvement in the construction of knowledge has enhanced.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;The most impressive theory that has contributed to my learning, in my recent stage in nursing education, is the connectivism theory, which is considered as a modern theory to be the modern-day theory due to the involvement of digital way of learning (Utley, 2011). This theory has involved the use of the social media, networks, and internet, as a form of professional communication. In connectivism theory, fresh information is continuously acquired. Siemens (2008) has discussed that connectivism is different from other theories because of five reasons; learning could occur through interaction socially and technologically; learning could take place in diversified network and strong network ties; transfer of learning and connection could be learned through adaptive patterns; and correlation of this theory to behaviorism in learning task, cognitivism for thinking critically and reasonably, and constructivism for the interactive and social participation in the diverse sources of knowledge (as cited in Utley, 2011). The connectivism theory could be associated with the use of technology aside from the electronic medical records (EMR), and personal computer programs, in connecting, and collaborating globally (Schmitt, Sims-Giddens, &amp; Booth, R. G., 2012). The existence of social media in the classroom, and network sites, and the use of e-portfolio, twitter, and Wikipedia, power point presentations, videos, and distant online education, could enhance learning and skills in nursing education, teaching, and learning process (Schmitt, Sims-Giddens, &amp; Booth, 2012).&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">As a nurse educator, the use of theories that could fit the learning styles and adaptation of the student should be given into consideration. The integration of the principles of learning, and the scope of practice of an academic nurse educator should be combined with the preferred educational theory, to enhance effective teaching and learning process. The educational theories could guide the individualized learning preference of the student, and these theories could support the nurse educator’s teaching strategies.</span></blockquote></div>
